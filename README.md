# PRODIGY_NT1
# Implement Caesar Cipher
As I embark on my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I am excited to dive into the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. This initial phase of my internship is focused on gaining practical experience in identifying vulnerabilities, securing systems, and learning about encryption and data protection. I look forward to applying my knowledge to real-world challenges and growing my skills in this dynamic field.



# Project Overview

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This Python script allows users to both encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value.

# Features

Encryption and Decryption: Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher method.

Shift Customization: Allows users to specify the number of positions each letter should be shifted.

Handles Uppercase and Lowercase: The script can handle both uppercase and lowercase letters appropriately.

Non-Alphabet Characters: Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged, preserving spaces and punctuation.

# How to Use


Clone the Repository: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script using the command python caesar_cipher.py in your terminal or command prompt.

Follow the Prompts: Enter the message you wish to encrypt or decrypt and the desired shift value.
